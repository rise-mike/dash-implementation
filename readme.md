# Dashboard - Implementations

## What it is?
This is a small app to display current implementations in progress in a Gantt chart, as well as department and specialist statistics.

- Dashboard will display a full-page Gantt chart of in progress implementations, updated every 6 hours.
- Projects will display a list of implementations in progress, with expandable rows to view more in-depth info
- Specialists will display stats about each Implementations Specialist including number of tasks outstanding, next go-live, etc

## TODO
1. Tweak header styling
    - links should display as white
    - Logo and title may not be vertically centered
2. Chart Styling
    - Font needs to be on brand
    - Colouring - change based on overdue status of project
    - Background row colours, replace with clear lines.
3. Data
    - Test extract from Projects, write transformation functions
